# charging-stations
A simple expo app for finding nearest public ev charging stations and starting the charging operation in ev.energy server.

To run this app, you need to have [Expo Cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed.
You can run the app on iOS or Android simulator or on a real device using Expo Go. I have tested this app only on iOS Simulator.

The app uses the devices location. See [instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/#enabling-emulator-location) for how to enable location on iOS or Android simulators.

To run the app, type:

npm install

expo start
